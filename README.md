This is a client-side application for the Noteful project

In this application, we:

	-Can connect with the server-side noteful application to handle all CRUD requests.
	-Connect with server-side to store all notes and folders in a database.
	-View all notes stored in a local API.
	-Filter notes by a folder name.
	-Add a note by name, folder, and content.
	-Delete a note.

I utilized the below in creating this application:

	-Create-React-App
	-React class components
	-BrowserRouter
	-Context
	-Controlled forms
	-Prop Types
